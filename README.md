# SabreCSG

SabreCSG is a set of level design tools for building complex levels quickly inside Unity.

Using Constructive Solid Geometry techniques SabreCSG allows you to add and subtract brushes to create great levels without needing to understand 3D art packages.

The brushes are used as a template for building the final geometry allowing you unprecedented flexibility for making minor tweaks or big changes simply by modifying the brushes.</p> |
| **POWERFUL BRUSH AND GEOMETRY TOOLS** <p>SabreCSG comes equipped with a whole range of tools for editing brushes and geometry, from intuitive resize tools which let you quickly block out spaces to vertex and edge editing modes which let you go in and tweak in more detail, to advanced clipping tools allowing you to bevel or cut entire brushes in two.</p> | [![Introduction Image 2](https://github.com/sabresaurus/SabreCSG/wiki/images/home-introduction-2.png)](https://github.com/sabresaurus/SabreCSG/wiki/images/home-introduction-2.png) |

And with newly upgraded features thereâ€™s a whole set of new helper functions to speed up your workflow.</p> |

SabreCSG was originally sold on the [Unity Asset Store](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/47418), but as of 14th October 2016 has been [open sourced](http://sabrecsg.com/2016/10/14/sabrecsg-released-as-open-source/) under the MIT License (see LICENSE for details). It is now maintained on this [Github repository](https://github.com/sabresaurus/SabreCSG).

## Core Features:

- Boolean CSG algorithm supporting partial rebuilding.
- Draw tools to rapidly create levels by drawing brushes directly.
- Resize tools allow you to resize spaces intuitively.
- Vertex tools to refine and add precision details.
- Change materials or edit UVs with surface tools built for level design.
- Clip planes allow you to bevel brushes or even split them in two.
- Export built geometry to .OBJ for use in external 3D tools.
- Vertex Colors - Apply vertex colors per face which are baked into the built meshes.
- Experimental Code API - Experimental support for procedurally generating levels through code.
